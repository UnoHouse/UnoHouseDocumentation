# UnoHouse Privileges

## Privileges
As described earlier, system utilize Roles system. That mean, every role has certain set of privileges.
for each role we can choose what operation can be made. In simple matrix where we have combination of Roles and privs.
 This approach allow us to manage every single priv, grant or remove it from Role.
 
Each role can be managed in Web application. Users can have only one role.
## Purpose of roles

To determine privileges and responsibilities of each user, we had to separate roles and accounts.
In order to control system it's important to check for privileges. Every role have different access level.
